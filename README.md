# Overview

For this project I wanted to learn how to use Android Studio and since I previously learned Kotlin I wanted to apply it and create a simple app that I can expand on later once I learn how to do more complex things in Android Studio and possibly databases as well. 

I really like to cook and sometimes I find recipes online and dont have a good way of storing them so to solve this I made an app to store my recipes. Put very simply I made a main screen where you could input the name of the recipe, the ingredients, and the instructions on how to prepare the food. Once the user inputs all the information they click the button at the bottom of the screen and it will take them to another screen prompting them that the recipe was added.

# Development Environment

While woring on this project I used the following:
* VS Code
* Android Studio
* Kotlin Language

# Useful Websites

These are the two main websites that I used to learn about Android Studio and Kotlin as well. 
* [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/guide)
* [Kotlin Website](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)

# Future Work

Some of the things that I would do in the future if I had time to expand on the code and when I learn more about Android Studio and some form of databases. 
* I would create a main screen where you can see any recipes that have been previously inputed. 
* When the new screen appears I would like it to display the whole recipe instead of just the name of the recipe. 
* Lastly I would probably improve the appearance of the app so it looks nicer.
